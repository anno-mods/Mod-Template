This is a dummy readme describing what you mod does.

## Steps you should take: 

- If you have no clue on how to use github, you can just use the [github desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) app and [clone the repository](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/adding-and-cloning-repositories/cloning-and-forking-repositories-from-github-desktop)

- implement your mod on your machine. You can also make a copy of the files, put them into your anno mods folder, implement there, and when you are done, copy your files back to the github folder.

- make sure you add information about the mod into modinfo.json. A detailed explanation on how to do it can be found [here](https://github.com/anno-mods/Modinfo)

- Publish a release of your mod so people can easily download it.
